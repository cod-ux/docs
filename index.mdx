# Welcome to Doppler

Doppler is an AI prompt engineer you can access via API. Send your prompts for AI agents (optionally with tool schemas) and specify a prompt engineering task to change your agent's behavior. Doppler runs simulations, improves prompts, and reruns simulations until the new prompt achieves your desired task.

This is an **evals-driven prompt improvement API** that acts as your AI prompt engineer.

## Quick Start

## How Doppler Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Submit Your Task">
    Send your current prompt, target model, and desired behavior changes via the
    `/create_task` endpoint. This returns a task_id immediately.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Doppler Optimizes">
    Our AI runs simulations and iteratively improves your prompt based on your
    specified criteria
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get Results">
    Retrieve the status of your task using the task_id with the `/get_results`
    endpoint. Once completed, it will return your optimized prompt and
    performance metrics.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## API Endpoints

Doppler provides two core endpoints to power your prompt engineering workflow.
